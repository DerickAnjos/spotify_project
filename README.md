# Spotify Charst - Exploratory Data Analysis
Project with spotify's chart dataset 

The goal of this Project is to explore, bring insights and curiosities from the world of music. For this, we use data from Spotify, the largest music streaming service in the world, which according to Forbes holds more than 31% of the global market.

To perform the Exploratory Analysis, we used data from all the "Top 200" published globally by Spotify from the period between 2017 and 2021, with an interval of 2-3 days between them. The structured dataset has more than 26 million rows and 9 variables.

The final result (Data viz) of the Exploratory Data Analysis can be found on my Tableau Public profile: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/derickanjos/viz/EDA-Spotify/EDA-Spotifyartistview
